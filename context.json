The more he gives to others, the more he has for his own\"\nA wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn from a wise answer\nIt is not the answer that enlightens, but the question\nWherever you go, no matter what the weather, always bring your own sunshine\nThe only one who can tell you 'you can't' is you. And you don't have to listen.\nThe only limits in life are the ones you make\nIt is not what we get, but who we become, what we contribute... that gives meaning to our lives\nLife is like a roller coaster. It has its ups and downs, but its your choice to scream or enjoy the ride\nA journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step\nA little knowledge is a dangerous thing\nThe only limits in life are the ones you make\nIt is not what we get, but what we give that makes life meaningful"}
